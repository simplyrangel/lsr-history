# Using pdflatex
This repository uses pdflatex to generate documents. Pdflatex is a TeX modification which allows TeX to output to PDF directly. Check the LateX webpage (https://www.latex-project.org/get/) for installation instructions. 

The report uses several tex packages. My latex distribution required me to download the following packages before I could successfully create documents with a bibliography and a way to references sources in the document. 
```console
sudo apt-get install texlive-bibtex-extra
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
```

The report uses the bibtex package to manage citations and bibliographies. Bibtex relies on several files that can be autogenerated with an intermediate step after `pdflatex texfile.tex` is first run. The following command sequence is required if any changes to the report's citations or bibliography are made:
```console
pdflatex texfile.tex
bibtex texfile
pdflatex texfile.tex
```
