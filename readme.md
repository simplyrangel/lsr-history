# Installing pdflatex
This repository uses pdflatex to generate documents. Pdflatex is a TeX modification which allows TeX to output to PDF directly. Check the LateX webpage (https://www.latex-project.org/get/) for installation instructions. 

The report uses several tex packages. My latex distribution required me to download the following packages before I could successfully create documents with a bibliography and a way to references sources in the document. 
```console
sudo apt-get install texlive-bibtex-extra
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
```
